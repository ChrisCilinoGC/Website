# Welcome To the GCentral Indexer

## What is the Indexer?
The GCentral Indexer is the back-end implementation and front end presentation of VI Packages, NI Packages, and G Packages in various repositories, inducing GCentral's own repositories. The indexer is displayed in GCentral.org and represents the "Find / Discover" portion of the mission. 
GCentral's goal is to empower the community to build GCentral into the tool it needs. Therefore we are open-sourcing as much of the indexer and website as possible so you can lend your passion and expertise to the cause. Without you efforts GCentral simply will not happen.
